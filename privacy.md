Effective Date: 05/21/2019

BY VISITING JenniferAndEamon.com, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY.

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit https://www.jenniferandeamon.com/ (the “Site”).

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” We may also collect information about you from third parties, using tools like Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

  “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.<br>
  “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br>
  “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.

Additionally, when you RSVP through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, the names of your additional guests, dietary restrictions, email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as "RSVP Information.”

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and RSVP Information.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use the RSVP Information that we collect generally to plan for our wedding.  Additionally, we use this RSVP Information to:<br>

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our invitees/guests browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing campaigns).

We may merge your RSVP Information and Device Information with data provided by other parties, such as Google Analytics.
